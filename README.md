### BashScript-setupGodotProjectDirectoryStructure
Bash script (so should work on Linux and Mac, but now Windows) to setups a starting project directory structure. After you make an empty Godot project, run this script in the root project folder. This is just a directory structure I made based on personal preferences, once we decide on a standard directory structure for the community we can update this to match that decision. Also gonna need a Windows user to make a version of the script that works in Windows.
